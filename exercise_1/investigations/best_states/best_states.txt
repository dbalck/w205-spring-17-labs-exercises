Like the hospitals, states were chosen based on the averaged z-scores of procedures that occured in hospitals of that state. In certain cases, such as for AS (American Samoa), there were not enough providers to make an adequate sample size. Nonetheless, our top states were Wyoming, South Dakota, and Kansas. These are all very sparsely populated, which is somewhat supported in literature that more rural populations have better health outcomes. Another column -- hcahps_base_score was also added. This acts as a proxy for patient satisfaction, and we found that the top states generally did better in terms of their patient feedback as well.
